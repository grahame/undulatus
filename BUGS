Key:
  - multiple user support; just rebind all the commands 
  on user switch (neat!!)
  - change comamnds to have help, a better argument parser
  so we don't have to redo all the validation everywhere

Hit list:
  - reply all includes your own username
  - show times with 'x ago'
  - should be able to view recent tweets for a user
  - direct messages received (timeline? sep?)
  - prime the cache when we start up, feed in the last N tweets
  in the database

Long term:
  - block updates while typing
  - url shortening (optional, how?)
  - searching (possibly ongoing? add a timeline?)
  - piping? sorting? how overengineered and crazy do we want to get?
  - save out tweets (to json? what? text?)
  - show top sources of tweets in cache
  - command start a python shell to inspect what's going on
  - track follows and unfollows
  - whois should show if they follow you?
  - improve RT handling in the code. uniqueness should take into account embedded RTs
    stop issueing key codes to RT parent tweets? not sure about that one
  - google translate integration
