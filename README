Undulatus, a command line twitter client based upon the 
python twitter tools package.

See the file 'LICENSE' for licensing and copyright information.

You'll need to have ptt installed:
http://mike.verdone.ca/twitter/

You'll also need Django 1.2 installed. All tweets are stored in an SQL
database for archival purposes.

Things are pretty rough right now. Make sure you use the 'twitter' 
command from 'ptt' to authorize 'ptt' and 'undulatus' to use your 
twitter account.

Then, initialise the database:
  python manage.py syncdb

Finally, run the Undulatus shell:
  ./shell.py
