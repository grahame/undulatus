Undulatus, a command line twitter client based upon the 
python twitter tools package.

See the file 'LICENSE' for licensing and copyright information.

You'll need:
  Python 3.1

  PTT (ported by me to Python 3):
  https://github.com/grahame/twitter/tree/python3
  
  SqlAlchemy 0.6 (available in Debian as python3-sqlalchemy)

All tweets are stored in an SQL database for archival / future analysis.

Things are pretty rough right now. Make sure you use the 'twitter' 
command from 'ptt' to authorize 'ptt' and 'undulatus' to use your 
twitter account.

Then just launch undulatus:
./undulatus.py

Dev notes
---------

Threading model should eventually look like:

               call buffer
	          |
  [ network thread -> makes api requests ]
                  |
              output buffer
	          |
  [ database thread -> prints to stdout ]
