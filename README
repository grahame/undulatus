Undulatus, a command line twitter client based upon the 
python twitter tools package.

See the file 'LICENSE' for licensing and copyright information.

You'll need to have ptt installed:
http://mike.verdone.ca/twitter/

You'll also need sqlalchemy 0.6 installed.
All tweets are stored in an SQL database for archival / future analysis.

Things are pretty rough right now. Make sure you use the 'twitter' 
command from 'ptt' to authorize 'ptt' and 'undulatus' to use your 
twitter account.

Then just launch undulatus:
./undulatus.py
